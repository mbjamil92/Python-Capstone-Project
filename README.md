# Python-Capstone-Project
This folder contains my undergrad capstone project code, my research papaer, my thesis, and my project poster as well.

The main idea is to build an intelligent autonomous robot using Raspberry Pi whose utility will be demonstrated in a receptionist/guide at the premises of COMSATS Institute of Information Technology(CIIT) or at any other organization for example as a hotel receptionist. This robot is programmed to receive and guide the guest arriving at the institution to a predefined destination by overcoming all obstacles in its way .The approach of building a robot receptionist/guide can help attract more people to CIIT, giving the institution more recognition by introducing interactive robots into the environment. The robot will perform its task in a wireless networked environment controllable from a remote location within the range of a wireless router and a GPS module is also used. This approach will allow a distant user to monitor and control the robot more efficiently and effectively unlike a wired system where small distance control is a major limitation
